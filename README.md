## What it Does

Mindtrip allows users to **mint** (create) a digital memory of places they discover on the map. Each memory is stored as a "block" containing:

- **Place Name:** The name of the discovered location.
- **Location Coordinates:** Precise latitude and longitude of the place.
- **Timestamp:** The date and time when the memory was created.
- **Unique Hash:** A digital fingerprint ensuring the integrity and uniqueness of each memory.
- **Link to the Previous Block:** Connecting each memory to the previous one, forming a secure and immutable chain.

This blockchain-inspired system ensures that each digital memory is securely stored and easily traceable, providing users with a reliable and innovative way to document their journeys.
